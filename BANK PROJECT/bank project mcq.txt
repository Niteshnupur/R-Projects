Q10 = R2 or adjusted R2, which metric to be used to check goodness of the model?


I know higher the value of R-square directly proportionate to good model.
linear regression we should look at adjusted R square instead of R square.
always suggested that you use Adjusted R-squared to judge goodness of model.

ans = adjusted R2



Q9 = How is box plot upper whisker is calculated ?

The length of the upper whisker is the largest value that is no greater than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range. 
In this case, the third quartile plus 1.5 times IQR is 10 + 1.5*6 = 19. 
The largest value that is no greater than 19 is 13, so the upper whisker will reach to 13.

ans =  Q3 + 1.5×IQR



Q8 = Whether the data given (train data) is a balanced or extremely imbalanced data( ratio of response class counts even more extreme than 5%:95%)?

5% of 95%

5% × 95 = (5 ÷ 100) × 95 = (5 × 95) ÷ 100 = 475 ÷ 100 = 4.75,

Answer: 5% of 95 = 4.75 

Balanced



Q7 = Does validation help in generalising the model?


Validation set actually can be regarded as a part of training set, because it is used to build your model

Generalisation: Your model should be generalise enough to do prediction for unknown.
Test Data: Validate your model prediction capaability.


Yes


Q6 = Should the variable ID be included in building the model?

No



Q5 = Model with 'lower AIC' value is a better model or the model with 'higher AIC' value?


lower AIC



Q4 = which function is used to remove multicollinearity among variables?

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

ans = vif


Q3 = Find the variance of variable balance.

 9273256




Q2 = Total number of outliers present in the variable balance.Use ‘Q1-1.5*IQR’ to calculate lower limit and ‘Q3 + 1.5×IQR’ to calculate upper limit. 
calculate the count of values in variable balance which are beyond these limits.


ans = 3329



Q1 = Find mean of the variable age. Round off to 2 decimal places.

ans = 40.94
